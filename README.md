The game Bagels by Al Sweigart but using keywords: Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz

"""Bagels, is a deducative logic game where you must guess a number based on clues.
Where the word Pico = when a guess is correct but in the wrong place, 
Fermi = when a guess is correct and in the right place,
and Bagels = when a guess is incorrect. You have 10 tries.
Tags: short, game, puzzle.

This game was written by Al Sweigart.

I've changed the code to make a Fizz, Buzz, FizzBuzz game but with the Bagel's logic.
so that:
Fizz = when a guess is correct but in the wrong place, 
Buzz = when a guess is correct and in the right place,
and FizzBuzz = when a guess is incorrect. You have 10 tries."""
